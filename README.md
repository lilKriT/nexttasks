## Optional Goals

- [] Create model and CRUD for users.

# What I learned so far

- routes are document based: To make about page, create `about/page.tsx` file.
- I can create custom layouts for each page.
- I can use next/link to link to other pages. No `<a>` required!
- I can put metadata in layout, or in the page itself.
- I can import google fonts.
